# Describe Cloud Computing 


### Learning Objectives 
- Define Cloud Computing
- Describe the Shared Responsibility Model
- Define Cloud Models, including public, private and hybrid
- Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model
- Describe the consumption-based model
- Compare cloud models


### What is Cloud Computing 
- Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like IoT, ML and AI.

- Since Cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesnt have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is.

- That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you dont have to wait to build a new datacenter, you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.

- The two services provided by most cloud providers are compute power and storage.


### Describe the Shared Responsibility Model 

- WIth a traditional corporate datacenter. The company is responsible for maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining for replacing the servers if anything happens. The IT department is responsible for maintaining all the infrastructure and software needed to keep the datacenter up and running 

- The Shared responsibility Model means these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer. Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are responsibility of the cloud provider.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you deploy a virtual machine and installed an SQL database on it, the consumer is responsible for database patches and updates
> WIth an on-premises datacenter, the consumer is responsible for everything
